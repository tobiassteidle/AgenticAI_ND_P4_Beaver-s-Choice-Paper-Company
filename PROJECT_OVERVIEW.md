# The Beaver's Choice Paper Company Needs Your Help!

## Introduction

Welcome! Imagine yourself as a trusted and seasoned consultant specialized in building smart, efficient, and powerful
agent-based workflows. Businesses rely on you to solve their complex operational challenges with cutting-edge solutions.
Your latest client, the Beaver's Choice Paper Company, urgently requires your expertise to revolutionize their inventory
management and quoting system. Your role? Develop a multi-agent system that streamlines their operations, enabling quick
quote generation, accurate inventory tracking, and ultimately driving increased sales.

## The Challenge

The Beaver's Choice Paper Company is struggling with managing their paper supplies, responding promptly to customer
inquiries, and generating competitive quotes. They're overwhelmed and losing potential sales due to inefficiencies. Your
challenge is to design and implement a multi-agent solution, restricted to at most five agents, capable of handling
inquiries, checking inventory status, providing accurate quotations, and completing transactions seamlessly. Your
solution must ensure responsiveness, accuracy, and reliability in managing requests and maintaining optimal stock
levels.

# Core Components of the Multi-agent System

In this project, you must ensure that the Beaver's Choice Paper Company's needs are met through a multi-agent system
implementation. To maintain simplicity and effectiveness, the system should involve at most five agents. Your solution
will handle strictly text-based inputs and outputs, and you will verify its performance using a provided set of sample
requests. Begin your project by creating a diagram that clearly outlines your intended workflow. You may choose among
three Python frameworks for your agent implementation: smolagents, pydantic-ai, or npcpy. Your completed program should
contain agents that can:
- Answer questions regarding current inventory and manage the reordering of supplies when necessary, demonstrating your agents' ability to use database information effectively and to make purchase decisions.
- Provide accurate and intelligent quotes for potential customers by considering historical quote data and pricing strategies.
- Efficiently finalize sales transactions based on the available inventory and delivery timelines.

Your submission must include:

- The workflow diagram (an image file)
- Your source code (only one python file should be submitted)
- A detailed document that thoroughly explains the system you've built and describes how you ensured it meets all specified requirements.

You'll utilize the knowledge that you gained about multi-agent systems along with your skills in Python programming, database management (sqlite3), and an agent orchestration framework of your choice to execute this project.

# Project Summary
This exciting 6-hour project is divided into key steps:

- **Diagramming & Planning:** Create a detailed flow diagram outlining your multi-agent system.
- **Implementation:** Develop your multi-agent system using Python and your chosen agent framework.
- **Testing & Debugging:** Thoroughly test your agents using provided sample inputs to ensure robust performance.
- **Documentation:** Write a comprehensive report explaining your system, your design decisions, and how your solution meets the project requirements.
